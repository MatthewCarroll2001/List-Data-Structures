# List-Data-Structures
A collection of list-based data structures that I implemented based on my knowledge from school and java. 
All code was written by me originally including scripts and tests.

# Data Structures Included
* ArrayList
* LinkedList
* ArrayStack
* LinkedStack
* ArrayQueue
* LinkedQueue

# Other Features
* Interfaces for several different levels of abstraction including List, Stack, Queue, Collection, and ArrayType
* Nodes and LinkedNodes generalized for any Object
* Since nodes are general in terms of type allowed, any combination of types can be added to a single list (akin to python lists)
* JUnit test cases for all six different data structures (all tests pass)
