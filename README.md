# List-Data-Structures
A set of simple list based data structures defined from scratch by me

# Data Structures Included
* ArrayList
* LinkedList
* ArrayStack
* LinkedStack
* ArrayQueue
* LinkedQueue

# Other Features
* Interfaces for several different levels of abstraction including List, Stack, Queue, Collection, and ArrayType
* Nodes and LinkedNodes generalized for any Object
* Since nodes are general in terms of type allowed, any combination of types can be added to a single list (akin to python lists)
